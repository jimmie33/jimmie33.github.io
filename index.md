I am interested in solving real world problems using computer vision and machine learning. At Adobe, I work on research and tech transfer projects related to deep learning, image processing and intelligent systems. Before joining Adobe, I studied computer vision with [Prof. Stan Sclaroff](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~sclaroff/) at Boston University and got my PhD in 2016.
