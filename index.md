I am interested in solving real world problems using computer vision and machine learning. At Adobe, I work on research and tech transfer projects related to deep learning, image processing and intelligent systems. Before joining Adobe, I studied computer vision with [Prof. Stan Sclaroff](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~sclaroff/) at Boston University and got my PhD in 2016.

## Tech Transfer Highlights

![](img/select-subject.jpg) 
* __Select Subject__ in Photoshop CC 2018 [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/x-9qYLr15tU)]. Deep learning based salient object detection with high boundary accuracy. This is one of the first few Sensei powered features in Adobe flagship products. I designed and developed the deep learning algorithm behind this feature.
