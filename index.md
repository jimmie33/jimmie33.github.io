I am interested in solving real world problems using computer vision and machine learning. At Adobe, I work on research and tech transfer projects related to deep learning, image processing and intelligent systems. Before joining Adobe, I studied computer vision with [Prof. Stan Sclaroff](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~sclaroff/) at Boston University and got my PhD in 2016. I recevied my M.S. and B.S. degree in Math at Tsinghua University in 2008 and 2011 respectively.

* __Sky Replacement__ in Photoshop 2021 [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/K_jWJ7Z-tKI)]. Later shipped to Lightroom. Starting as a research project years ago, we spent a lot of effort to make this technology achieve the quality level that would satifiy the picky professionals. I developed the backbone masking and compositing technologies and worked closely with the PS team to polish this feature. The final form of this feature is simple, flexible and powerful. It just shines!
